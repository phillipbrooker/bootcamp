This is the GitHub repository that stores all the templates and code files associated with the NCRM Programming withe Python for Social Scientists Bootcamp 2021.

The idea is that you can access all the code files you need for the course from this one place (and they will be organised in "branches" (kind of like folders) so you should know where they live), and we can also use GitHub as a tool for sharing and presenting any code projects you develop as part of the course too.

Looking forward to getting into the course with you!
