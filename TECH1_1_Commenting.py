TECHNICAL 1. 1. COMMENTING
"""

#In this script you can see two types of comment. Some comments, like those
#at the top of this page, are denoted by the use of three speech marks.
#There, you can see that there are three speech marks to 'open' the comment,
#then there is the comment itself, and then three speech marks to 'close' the
#comment. Whatever is between the two sets of speech marks is a comment.

#However, you can also see that comments can be denoted by putting a hash at
#the start of the comment - this is what you can see in this line for instance.
