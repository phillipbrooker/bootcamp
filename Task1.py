TASK 1:
Here's a list of 18 objects. Can you help me put these into three groups (lists)
of six items each, where the items are selected randomly, using only Python
commands (e.g. no copying and pasting or manually writing out data!)?

objects = ["matches", "torch", "rucksack", "keys", "wallet", "phone",
           "notepad", "pen", "snack", "lipstick", "charger", "laptop",
           "bottle", "headphones", "book", "watch", "glasses", "pencil"]

Having done this, can you then add each of the three groups together in one
big list-of-list, again sing only python commands?

HINT: the "shuffle(OBJECT)" command could be useful here, and so will planning
out the code in advance to figure when would be best to do the shuffling (and
which object or objects you want to shuffle). To use "shuffle()", you will have
to use the line "from random import shuffle" at the top of your script.
