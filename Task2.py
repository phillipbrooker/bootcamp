TASK 2:
My eldest can never decide what he wants for tea, so to make the next three days
easier for me, can you randomly assign a meal to a day, using the lists below?

days = ["Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
meals = ["pizza", "spaghetti bolognese", "chicken and wedges"]

HINT: the "shuffle(OBJECT)" command could be useful here, and so will planning
out the code in advance to figure when would be best to do the shuffling (and
which object or objects you want to shuffle). To use "shuffle()", you will have
to use the line "from random import shuffle" at the top of your script.

HINT: You should also look up "zipping" as a technique here - the Python
documentation and/or Google will be helpful.
