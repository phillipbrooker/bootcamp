TASK 3:
Here we have a simple dictionary containing details of three peoples' Twitter
accounts and the number of followers they have:

followers = {"@pdbrooker": 348,
             "@mark_carrigan": 16000,
             "@ProgSocSci": 49}

Can you iterate through that dictionary and print out a string that adds some
context to each key/value pairing (e.g. "The ACCOUNT_NAME Twitter account has
NUMBER followers.")?

HINT: this task incorporates a range of different techniques already covered,
from string formatting methods, to dictionary methods, to iterations (e.g. for
and/or while loops). As such, planning out what steps your script should take
ahead of writing it will be really helpful.
