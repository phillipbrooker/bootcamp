#following attributes:
    #Date of birth
    #Place of birth

    #Favourite film

#(2) Add a key and value to your dictionary denoting your favourite band or
#artist. Use ONLY dictionary methods to do this.

#(3) Delete the "Place of birth" field and replace it with one called "Current
#residence" - put the town you currently live in as the value.

#(4) Create an empty dictionary in a variable titled the name of your favourite
#album by your favourite band/artist.

#dictionary with the following keys (and give them values):
    #Year of release
    #Number of tracks
#Do steps (4) and (5) for two or three albums by that band.
