This technical session gives you four templates of tasks that have a relevance to social scientific work in Python generally - data mining, creating a Twitter bot (this template also can be used to scrape data from Twitter), visualising data in graph form, and web scraping.

The idea for this technical session is to pick one of the templates you'd like to try out in a small group collaboration, design a project that speaks to your research interests or needs, and use the template to inform how you tackle the problem.

This repository therefore has different "branches" (folders) within the technical-5 folder pertaining to each individual task you could choose - these are:

- data-mining
- twitter-bot
- visualising-data
- web-scraping

As some of these tasks require you to install additional Python libraries, there is also a guide to installing libraries in the technical-5 folder (though if you are having particular issues with this aspect, it may be possible for Phil to help with these).
